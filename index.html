      <h3>May 2021 - now: AT - Online English Tutor</h3>
      <p>In 2021 when covid cases started increasing at an alarming rate in Taiwan, I quit my job as a cram school teacher and started my online teaching career. Now I am a freelancer working as an English teacher on AmazingTalker. I have accumulated over 2170 hours of classes over the years.

      <h3> Sept 2018 - Apr 2021: B3 English School - English Teacher</h3>
      <p>I planned and executed lessons of English skill-building for reading, writing, listening, and speaking weekly. I will tailor my teaching plans to their ages, levels, and needs. I achieve my teaching goals by giving them motivation. Therefore, creating a fun learning environment is mandatory. I always incorporate warm-up activities before my lessons and review games at the end of the class. It was a challenging but fulfilling journey. </p>

      <h3>Nov 2016 - Jun 2018: APIP - International Executive Secretary</h3>
      <p>My primary job was to serve as a bridge between the company, overseas construction companies, and buyers. Therefore, fluent English and Chinese with decent communication skills were the basic requirements. Our responsibilities were to translate and take care of our client's needs. I would inform the owners of any notices regarding their houses.  </p>
